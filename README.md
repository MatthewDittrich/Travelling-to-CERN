# Travelling to CERN
  Congratulations! If you are reading this, you are probably preparing for your first trip to CERN (or you are here as a quick refresher which is ok too). The following steps are here to help guide you along the process and answer any questions you may have.
## 1. Passport and Visa Information -> [CMS Secretariat Visa Information](https://cms-secretariat.web.cern.ch/visa)
  - ### Passport Requirements
    - Make sure you have a **valid** passport for your travel. This means the passport must be valid 6 months after the last date of your planned travel. 
  - ### Visa Requirements
    - #### US Citizens
      - Less Than 90 Days
        - You are permitted to travel to both France and Switzerland for 90 days without a Visa as a tourist. However, you are                       *technically* defined as a worker in France and Switzerland (even though UF is paying you).  
        - **Officially**, you should apply for a Schengen Visa and obtain a Convention d'accueil. 
          - For the Schengen Visa, you will need to request a [invitation letter](https://espace.cern.ch/CMSSEC-Invitation-letters-site/SitePages/Home.aspx) from the CMS secretariat. Once obtained, you will need to scedule an appointment with the nearest Swiss or French consulate (Atlanta, GA?). **Make sure this appointment is at least 3 weeks before your trip** (five weeks is the recommendation).
          - The Convention d'accueil is much easier to obtain. All you need to do is request one from the [CMS Secretariat](https://cms-secretariat.web.cern.ch/) and request one. Typically, this process may take 7-10 business days. 
        - **UNOFFICIAL - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK:** Former graduate students with US passports have typically had no trouble at the Users office               office when they have shown up without a Visa (assuming their stay is for less than 90 days). Technically, this is not allowed, but it seems to work fine in most cases.
          - If you are planning to go without a Visa, make sure you have the Convention d'accueil and an Invitation letter with you. This can help cover you in case something at the Users office goes awry.
      - Longer Than 90 Days
        - For travelling to CERN for over 90 days, you will need to obtain a D-Type Visa. 
        - You will need to obtain an [invitation letter](https://espace.cern.ch/CMSSEC-Invitation-letters-site/SitePages/Home.aspx), and             schedule an appointment with the Swiss consulate if you are planning to live in Switzerland (French consulate if you are planning to live in France). 
    - #### Non-US Citizens
      - Less than 90 Days
        - You will need to obtain a C-Type Visa (Schengen Visa). Contact the [CMS Secretariat](https://cms-secretariat.web.cern.ch/) about getting an invitation letter and a Convention d'accueil.
        - Scedudule an appoitnment with the appropriate consulate at least 3 weeks before the start of your travel. 
      - Longer Than 90 Days
        - You will need to obtain a D-Type Visa for the Switzerland or France (depending where you plan to live). Like the short-term visa, ask the CMS secretariat for an invitation letter and a Convention d'accueil. 
        - Scedudule an appoitnment with the appropriate consulate at least 3 weeks before the start of your travel. 
## 2. Activating CERN Computing Account
  - You will need a CERN computing account for email, trainings, and many  other things. 
  - Email the [CERN service desk](service-desk@cern.ch) about getting an acoount setup. 
    - When emailing them, let them know you will be working with CMS experiment, and have your passport ready. They will probably ask you for a scan of it. 
## 3. Assistance from UF Physics Fiscal Team
  - ### Make a Travel Authorization (TA) request with the Physics Accounting manager or the Fiscal assistant.
    - You will most likely need the following:
      1. Purpose of travel
      2. Location of Travel (CERN - Geneva, Switzerland)
      3. Travel Dates (not landing dates!)
      4. Funding Source (your advisor can answer this question, but usually this is a some project number)
      5. Estimated Expenses
          - Plane Tickets
          - Hotel
          - Per Diem (As of 2022, UF will give $40 a day for food)
          - Uber receipt or miles driven to and from airport.
          - *If you are unsure if something is covered by UF. ASK! It usually is.*
    - Typically, an email to the [Physics Fiscal Team](fiscal@phys.ufl.edu) will suffice, but it is always nice to drop by their office to discuss what would be needed for a TA. 
  - ### Tips
    - It is possible to request an advance on your per-diem. This can help cover some initial costs that you may encounter at the beginning of the trip. 
    - When booking your hotel and flights, this can get pretty costly, but you have two options at your disposal:
      1. Purchase the tickets and hotel yourself and get a reimbursement once your travel is complete.
          - While not necessary, it is probably smart to let the [physics fiscal team](fiscal@phys.ufl.edu) know that you will be asking for a reimbursement after your travel.
      2. Have the department pay for the hotel and airline tickets before your travel.
          - For this option, contact the [physics fiscal team](fiscal@phys.ufl.edu) about having the department book the appropriate                   flight and hotel.
  - ### Insurance Forms
    - Ask the Physics Fiscal team about the paperwork for International Travel insurance. This is required for you to travel under UF, and it will cover you if anything major happens!
 ## 4. Pre-Registration and Home Institution Declaration Form
  - You will need to be pre-registered by UF's team leader or assistant team leader. 
    - At the time of writing this (2022), UF's team leader is Dr. Guenakh Mitselmakher, and the assistant team leader is Dr. Andrey Korytov. 
  - As the student, your part is to fill out a home institution declaration form ([HID form](https://usersoffice.web.cern.ch/sites/default/files/pdf/Formalities/HomeInstitutionDeclarationforUO.pdf)). This form will be needed when the pre-registration form is submitted by the team leader or assistant team leader. 
  - **TIP:** You will likely need to keep reminding the team leader about getting this pre-registration form filled out and completed (professors are quite busy), but it is important that you do so!
  - **TIP #2:** Email the CERN User's Office when the pre-registration is completed. Ask them if everything looks good for you to arrive on-site and get your access card. What may happen (and has happened to some of us) is they will inform you that the pre-registration was done improperly or more paperwork needs to be done. Better safe than sorry!
## 5. COVID Checks
  - It is best to check on any COVID restrictions that may exist for your travel.
    - Are you required to show a negative test?
    - Do you need proof of vaccine?
    - Check for France, Switzerland, and any layover countries you may stop at. 
  - You can also check the current [CERN Covid Status](https://hse.cern/covid-19-information) page to see if there are any COVID restirctions when you arrive.
