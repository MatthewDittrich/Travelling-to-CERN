# Travelling to CERN
  Congratulations! If you are reading this, you are probably preparing for your first trip to CERN (or you are here as a quick refresher which is ok too). The following steps are here to help guide you along the process and answer any questions you may have.
## 1. Passport and Visa Information -> [CMS Secretariat Visa Information](https://cms-secretariat.web.cern.ch/visa)
  - ### Passport Requirements
    - Make sure you have a **valid** passport for your travel. This means the passport must be valid 6 months after the last date of your planned travel. 
  - ### Visa Requirements
    - #### US Citizens
      - Less Than 90 Days
        - You are permitted to travel to both France and Switzerland for 90 days without a Visa as a tourist. However, you are                       *technically* defined as a worker in France and Switzerland (even though UF is paying you).  
        - **Officially**, you should apply for a Schengen Visa and obtain a Convention d'accueil. 
          - For the Schengen Visa, you will need to request a [invitation letter](https://espace.cern.ch/CMSSEC-Invitation-letters-site/SitePages/Home.aspx) from the CMS secretariat. Once obtained, you will need to scedule an appointment with the nearest Swiss or French consulate (Atlanta, GA?). **Make sure this appointment is at least 3 weeks before your trip** (five weeks is the recommendation).
          - The Convention d'accueil is much easier to obtain. All you need to do is request one from the [CMS Secretariat](https://cms-secretariat.web.cern.ch/) and request one. Typically, this process may take 7-10 business days. 
        - **UNOFFICIAL - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK:** Former graduate students with US passports have typically had no trouble at the Users office               office when they have shown up without a Visa (assuming their stay is for less than 90 days). Technically, this is not allowed, but it seems to work fine in most cases.
          - If you are planning to go without a Visa, make sure you have the Convention d'accueil and an Invitation letter with you. This can help cover you in case something at the Users office goes awry.
      - Longer Than 90 Days
        - For travelling to CERN for over 90 days, you will need to obtain a D-Type Visa. 
        - You will need to obtain an [invitation letter](https://espace.cern.ch/CMSSEC-Invitation-letters-site/SitePages/Home.aspx), and             schedule an appointment with the Swiss consulate if you are planning to live in Switzerland (French consulate if you are planning to live in France). 
    - #### Non-US Citizens
      - Less than 90 Days
        - You will need to obtain a C-Type Visa (Schengen Visa). Contact the [CMS Secretariat](https://cms-secretariat.web.cern.ch/) about getting an invitation letter and a Convention d'accueil.
        - Scedudule an appoitnment with the appropriate consulate at least 3 weeks before the start of your travel. 
      - Longer Than 90 Days
        - You will need to obtain a D-Type Visa for the Switzerland or France (depending where you plan to live). Like the short-term visa, ask the CMS secretariat for an invitation letter and a Convention d'accueil. 
        - Scedudule an appoitnment with the appropriate consulate at least 3 weeks before the start of your travel. 
## 2. Activating CERN Computing Account
  - You will need a CERN computing account for email, trainings, and many  other things. 
  - Email the [CERN service desk](service-desk@cern.ch) about getting an acoount setup. 
    - When emailing them, let them know you will be working with CMS experiment, and have your passport ready. They will probably ask you for a scan of it. 
## 3. Assistance from UF Physics Fiscal Team
  - ### Make a Travel Authorization (TA) request with the Physics Accounting manager or the Fiscal assistant.
    - You will most likely need the following:
      1. Purpose of travel
      2. Location of Travel (CERN - Geneva, Switzerland)
      3. Travel Dates (not landing dates!)
      4. Funding Source (your advisor can answer this question, but usually this is a some project number)
      5. Estimated Expenses
          - Plane Tickets
          - Hotel
          - Per Diem (As of 2022, UF will give $40 a day for food)
          - Uber receipt or miles driven to and from airport.
          - *If you are unsure if something is covered by UF. ASK! It usually is.*
    - Typically, an email to the [Physics Fiscal Team](fiscal@phys.ufl.edu) will suffice, but it is always nice to drop by their office to discuss what would be needed for a TA. 
  - ### Tips
    - It is possible to request an advance on your per-diem. This can help cover some initial costs that you may encounter at the beginning of the trip. 
    - When booking your hotel and flights, this can get pretty costly, but you have two options at your disposal:
      1. Purchase the tickets and hotel yourself and get a reimbursement once your travel is complete.
          - While not necessary, it is probably smart to let the [physics fiscal team](fiscal@phys.ufl.edu) know that you will be asking for a reimbursement after your travel.
      2. Have the department pay for the hotel and airline tickets before your travel.
          - For this option, contact the [physics fiscal team](fiscal@phys.ufl.edu) about having the department book the appropriate                   flight and hotel.
  - ### Insurance Forms
    - Ask the Physics Fiscal team about the paperwork for International Travel insurance. This is required for you to travel under UF, and it will cover you if anything major happens!
 ## 4. Pre-Registration and Home Institution Declaration Form
  - You will need to be pre-registered by UF's team leader or assistant team leader. 
    - At the time of writing this (2022), UF's team leader is Dr. Guenakh Mitselmakher, and the assistant team leader is Dr. Andrey Korytov. 
  - As the student, your part is to fill out a home institution declaration form ([HID form](https://usersoffice.web.cern.ch/sites/default/files/pdf/Formalities/HomeInstitutionDeclarationforUO.pdf)). This form will be needed when the pre-registration form is submitted by the team leader or assistant team leader. 
  - **TIP:** You will likely need to keep reminding the team leader about getting this pre-registration form filled out and completed (professors are quite busy), but it is important that you do so!
  - **TIP #2:** Email the CERN User's Office when the pre-registration is completed. Ask them if everything looks good for you to arrive on-site and get your access card. What may happen (and has happened to some of us) is they will inform you that the pre-registration was done improperly or more paperwork needs to be done. Better safe than sorry!

## 5. Place to Stay
  - You should talk with your advisor about where you will be staying. Overall though, there are two main options that you have. It is also a good idea to talk with other graduate students about where they have stayed to get a feel for what may suit you best. 
  - ### On CERN Site:
    - Pros
      - Very close to eveything you will need for research and work. 
      - Very good price.
      - Close to busses and tram for travel to Geneva. 
    - Cons
      - If you are bringing spouse/SO, can be difficult to get larger room. 
      - Grocery stores tend to be farther away. 
      - If you are primarily working at Prevessin site or P5, travel can be a bit long. 
  - ### Off CERN Site:
    - Pros
      - Lots of options.
      - Easier to find larger room.
      - Can be close to Prevessin site and/or P5. 
    - Cons
      - Can be a bit more pricy (especially as you get closer to Geneva).
      - Subject to availability. 


## 6. Safety and Introduction Courses
  - Once you have your computing account and pre-registration completed, it would be a good idea to knock out your mandatory [safety courses](https://lms.cern.ch/ekp/servlet/ekp/WIDGETCONTAINERPAGE?DECORATEPAGE=Y). 
  - If you are working in an area with high radiation (or you are required to have a dosimeter), you may also need to complete the Radiation Area - Supervised Area course. 
  

## 7. COVID Checks
  - It is best to check on any COVID restrictions that may exist for your travel.
    - Are you required to show a negative test?
    - Do you need proof of vaccine?
    - Check for France, Switzerland, and any layover countries you may stop at. 
  - You can also check the current [CERN Covid Status](https://hse.cern/covid-19-information) page to see if there are any COVID restirctions when you arrive. 
## 8. Before Travel Checks
  - Email the User's Office to ensure all paperwork is done. 
  - Contact your bank and let them know you will be travelling. This will make sure your credit/debit cards don't get frozen. 
  - Get your cell-phone plan situated. Some options are listed below:
    - Look into the interantional plan with your current provider.
    - Get an e-Sim (Orange mobile has some very good options for people travelling less than 90 days). 
    - Purchase a Sim card in Geneva (probably better for people staying longer term). 
  - Don't forget any medications.
  - Don't forget to get two adapters for Switzerland and France. Two-prong cables are the same in Swiss/France but 3-prongs are different. 
    - **Note:** Older electronics may not be able to handle the higher voltage in Europe. Newer laptops, phones, and such will be fine. 
## 9. Arrival Day 
  - ### Phone a Friend
    - If possible, see if another UF graduate student can meet up with you at the Geneva airport. Ideally, they would help you travel from the airport to CERN, and guide you along the initial steps to getting settled at CERN. 
  - ### Airport -> CERN
    - TPG (Bus/Tram System)
      - Easiest path from airport arrivals is to follow signs to rental car counters, then exit terminal and walk to the road (on left) where there is a bus stop. Take any bus that stops there except 10 (Buses 23, 28, 57) and exit at “Blandonnet”. Then take stairs up to tram station. Take Tram 18 to CERN (the last stop!) Take the direction heading west away from downtown.
    - Taxi
      - Most expensive option, but maybe the easiest depending on the time of day you arrive. Tell the driver you are wanting to go to CERN. 
    - CERN Shuttle
      - CERN does offer a free shuttle service. As of July 2022, this service has been temporarily disabled. Please check [this link](https://sce-dep.web.cern.ch/mobility/shuttle/circuit-4) to see if Circuit 4 is up and running again. 
    - Uber
  - ### Getting Your CERN Access Card (and Dosimeter if Needed)
    1. Head to BLDG 33 (across from the huge, iconic Globe of Science and Innovation).
        - Show your pre-registration form and passport to get a visitor's pass to enter the CERN site (they may ask for other documents so be prepared). 
    2. Head to BLDG 61 and look for the User's office to finish your registration. 
        - BLDG 61 is very close to Restuarant 1, the CERN library, and many other main attractions. 
    3. Head to BLDG 55 to get your official CERN Access Card. 
        - BLDG 55 is accessible 'outside' the CERN gates. Head back to BLDG 33, walk outside towards the blue dipole magnet, and you will see BLDG 55 in front of you. 
    4. Dosimeter
        - If needed, head upstairs in BLDG 55 to obtain a temporary Dosimeter. 
## 10. Requesting Access to Buildings
  - Your access card will allow you to enter most buildings on every CERN site.
  - ### Labs / Research Buildings
    - There may be specific research you are doing that will require access to a certain building (ask other graduate students or your advisor if you are not sure). 
      - If this is the case, you will need to [request access to that building](https://apex-sso.cern.ch/pls/htmldb_edmsdb/f?p=ADAMS3:ACRQ:1984281760736:::::). 
  - ### Office Space
    - You may also want to ensure that you have an office space when you are at CERN. 
      - Ask you advsior or other graduate students what offices they suggest. Ask around and see if there is an open desk with someone from UF already stationed at CERN. 
      - Request access to that office via [this link](https://apex-sso.cern.ch/pls/htmldb_edmsdb/f?p=ADAMS3:ACRQ:1984281760736:::::). 
## 11. Get Yourself Some Wheels
  - [CERN Bike](https://sce-dep.web.cern.ch/mobility/bike-rental)
    - CERN offers a rental bike service.
      - Fees are dependent on the time of year when you are renting the bike (never more than 1 CHF per day though). 
  - [CERN Car](https://home.cern/news/official-news/cern/use-car-sharing-service#:~:text=13%20January%2C%202020,service%20is%20being%20increasingly%20abused.)
    - CERN offers free cars that you can take from one CERN site to another.
    - This service does not allow you to travel for personal reasons. Cars should stay on CERN sites only unless travelling from one CERN site to another. 
    - **NOTE:** All of their cars are manuals. 
  - Rental Car
    - Most costly option, but may be a good idea for weekend trips with friends (split cost?). There are many rental car companies at the Geneva airport.
## 12. CERN Sites (Points)
  - Meyrin Site
    - This is Point 1, and will most likely be your main site. This site is right on the border of France and Switzerland. You can find the hostels, restaurants 1 and 2, CERN library, Users Office, and much more here. 
  - Point 5
    - The *home* of the CMS detector. Here you will probably be running shifts, or you may be getting (or giving!) a tour of the CMS detector. 
  - Prevessin Site
    - Radiation and beam studies for the CSCs are conducted here. You will be explicitly told by your advisor if you need to go to this site. 
  - [More Information on the different points](https://voisins.cern/en/cern-local-area)
## 13. Join a Club!
  - CERN offers tons of [clubs](https://indico.cern.ch/category/426/) (some of which are not even on that page). Even if you are only visiting for a couple of weeks, these clubs are a lot of fun! It is a great way to meet people and become active in the CERN community. 
## 14. Random (But Very Practical) Information
  - Tap water is safe to drink in Switzerland and France.
  - Time is typically given in 24 hour (military) format. 
  - CERN restaurants do accept credit cards, Apple pay, and Google pay. 
  - Dates are typically written in dd.mm.yyyy format. 
  - French is offically spoken in Switzerland and France, but CERN staff will know enough English to get by. 
  - There is a TPG app for the Geneva rail/bus system. 
  - There is a MapCERN app that can be handy if you are lost on one of the CERN sites (although all CERN sites have wifi, so it is not a huge help). 
  - You should bring some Swiss Francs and Euros for shops and such. 
  - If you are bringing a spouse/SO, they are eligible for a spouse access card so they can visit CERN sites as well. 
## 15. Stay Connected!
  - [CMS PubTalk](https://cms-talk.web.cern.ch/) is a great way to stay connected with the research area you are interested in. Use this site to keep up with talks and other events.
