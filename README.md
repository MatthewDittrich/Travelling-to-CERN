# Travelling to CERN
  Congratulations! If you are reading this, you are probably preparing for your first trip to CERN (or you are here as a quick refresher which is ok too). The following steps are here to help guide you along the process and answer any questions you may have.
## 1. Passport and Visa Information
  - ### Passport Requirements
    - Make sure you have a **valid** passport for your travel. This means the passport must be valid 6 months after the last date of your planned travel. 
  - ### Visa Requirements
    - #### US Citizens
      - Less Than 90 Days
        - You are permitted to travel to both France and Switzerland for 90 days without a Visa as a tourist. However, you are                       *technically* defined as a worker in France and Switzerland (even though UF is paying you).  
        - **Technically, it would be best to obtain a Schengen Visa, but you will be permitted to get your access card without one (from anecdotal stories).**
      - Longer Than 90 Days
    - #### Non-US Citizens
      - Less than 90 Days
      - Longer Than 90 Days
## 2. Activating CERN Computing Account
 - You will need a CERN computing account for email, trainings, and many  other things. 
  - Email the [CERN service desk](service-desk@cern.ch) about getting an acoount setup. 
  - When emailing them, let them know you will be working with CMS experiment, and have your passport ready. They will probably ask you       for a scan of it. 
## 3. Assistance from UF Physics Fiscal Team
  - Make a Travel Authorization (TA) request with the Physics Accounting manager or the Fiscal assistant.
    - You will most likely need the following:
      1. Purpose of travel
      2. Travel Dates (not landing dates!)
      3. Funding Source (your advisor can answer this question, but usually this is a some project number)
      4. Estimated Expenses
          - Plane Tickets
          - Hotel
          - Per Diem (As of 2022, UF will give $40 a day for food)
          - Uber receipt or miles driven to and from airport.
          - *When in doubt if something is covered by UF. ASK! It usually is.*
    - Typically, an email to the [Physics Fiscal Team](fiscal@phys.ufl.edu) will suffice, but it is always nice to drop by their office to discuss what would be needed for a TA.
